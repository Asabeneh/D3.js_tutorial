D3.js tutorial by d3Vienno Youtube

Hi all, 

I am currently on the road to a data scientist. My interest is in data analysis and data visualization. This is my draft papers when self-studying D3.js tutorial on youtube. 

Thanks to Vienno for the basic hand-on tutorial on [D3 js](https://youtu.be/2S1AbEWX85o?list=PL6il2r9i3BqH9PmbOf5wA5E1wOG3FT22p). 

Hope that I can finish this tutorial soon :D

Cheers,

Justine
